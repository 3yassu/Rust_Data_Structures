+ RUST DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS +

- I decided that to help increase my rust experience I would work on a series of data structures and algorithms
- so far Ive gotten Binary search trees, stacks, queues, and lists, but plan on getting to heaps
- and for algorithms all i've written is merge and quicksort with plans for radix sort, will try writing greedy algorithms eventually
